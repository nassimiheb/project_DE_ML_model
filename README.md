# Project Description :
In this project we aim to apply binary classification on <<dataset>> using <<algorithm>>. This project can be accessed for production using a docker image.

## Binary Classification
A frequent machine learning challenge is classifying data into one of two categories. You might wish to forecast if a consumer is likely to make a purchase, whether a credit card transaction was fraudulent, whether deep space signals indicate the presence of a new planet, or whether a medical test indicates the presence of a disease. All of these are binary classification problems.
